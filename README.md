UChicago CS Student Resource Guide:
The Computer Science Instructional Laboratory (CSIL), located in the first floor
of the John Crerar Library, includes two computer labs (CSIL 3 and 4) with
Linux machines in them. If there are no classes in progress in those labs,
you can sit at any available computer to access the UChicago CS Linux
environment (there are also Linux computers outside the labs, which you
 can use if the labs are occupied by a class).
